# mongo-homework
This is mongodb homework(part 1), thanks for reading this. I done all the task (with additional one) and those that we done on practice part as well. There is a bad values insertion maybe (but main task with students, values inserted by importing in db from students.json file).
All results are outputed in console. I would highly appreciate any criticism and i will try to fix all "bad practices" or bugs if you tell me about them.
